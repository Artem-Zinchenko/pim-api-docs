# Catalogs (beta)

## Overview

<!-- TODO -->

This guide introduces the catalog feature, which avoids you to add a filtering interface to your app as Akeneo PXM Studio already does it.

### What's a catalog?

With catalogs, Akeneo users can configure which products they want to share with your app thanks to a **product selection** composed of one or several criteria that allow you to filter products. 

When your app uses catalogs to retrieve product data, it automatically enables the Catalogs tab and creates catalogs in Akeneo.

### Step 2: Create catalogs

<!-- TODO -->

By default, when you create a catalog in the Akeneo PXM Studio, the catalog is disabled. It means that, until a user hasn't enabled it, you won't be able to retrieve products for this catalog. Note that only users can enable a catalog. 

::: warning
You can create **up to 15 catalogs** per app.
