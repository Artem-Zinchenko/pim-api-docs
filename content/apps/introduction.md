# What's an App ?

::: warning
The Apps are only available in the **6.0 version** and higher and for **SaaS** customers.

Before you start developing an App, it's important to understand what Apps can do and how they interact with the PIM.

An App is a service that can be easily connected to a PIM, directly from the PIM, 
with a streamlined process of activation and configuration.

An App can extend the PIM functionalities through the REST API, like a Connector, 
by retrieving or updating data and integrate it with external services.

The only constraint is that an App must have a single activation URL and should be hosted by its creator.
