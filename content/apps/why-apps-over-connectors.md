# Why should you choose an App over a connector?

Both connectors and Apps use the OAuth standard. However, there are some significant differences.

## Automatic configuration instead of manual configuration

### Connectors are using Akeneo PIM connections to get credentials

The user who connects Akeneo PIM with a connector must create a connection and manually configure authorizations and permissions. Then, they copy/paste generated API credentials from the PIM UI to the connector. 

### Apps are using the Connect feature

When a user connects Akeneo PIM with an App, they click on the Connect button then follow the step-by-step activation process to accept requested authorizations and set up permissions. The App receives everything it needs to interact with Akeneo PIM at the end of this process.

No more manual configuration issues and more transparency!

## High visibility

We give your App high visibility when you publish an App on our [Marketplace](https://marketplace.akeneo.com/). Your App displays on top of all connectors. 

We also give high visibility on Apps to our Akeneo PIM users. To do so, we created a dedicated section to highlight them in the PIM marketplace.

## Akeneo promotion

Akeneo promotes Apps, and all our internal teams believe in Apps and their future. Publish an App, and when we detect a customer who might need it, we will tell them about you.

Also, we will communicate about new Apps published on our Marketplace all along the year.

## Prepare the future now!

This is just the beginning. Our team will continue to develop new features for you to ease and accelerate the App development and publication in the coming year. 

And even if we already have a lot of ideas, get ready to hear about us! üéôÔ∏è
