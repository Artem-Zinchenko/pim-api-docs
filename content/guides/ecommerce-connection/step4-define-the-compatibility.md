# Define the compatibility of your connector

## Which version / edition of the PIM should my connector be “compatible” with?

As [mentioned before](step2-understand-akeneo-pim.html), there are [several editions](https://www.akeneo.com/compare-editions/) and several supported version of Akeneo PIM.

We encourage you to develop a connector that is fully compatible with our last **Serenity edition**.

Please, [start here](https://api.akeneo.com/getting-started/connect-the-pim-4x/welcome.html) to connect the PIM with the API!
 
## Which eCommerce solution versions should my connector be compatible with?

Well... that depends on your eCommerce solution and your business strategy.

You have to choose these versions accordingly:
* The number of potential users that have or will have this version.
* The lifetime of this version (it is useless to specifically develop a version compatible with a version of your eCommerce solution if this one doesn't exist anymore in a month or two).
