## Step by step...

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first!**

We are aware that it is almost difficult to develop a 100% complete connector that fit all your customer needs immediately.

Furthermore, to build such a complex connector as an ERP connector in a single iteration would undoubtedly be complex and you risk missing important features.

**Our last advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview Julia and ERP team about their needs
* Set priorities with them
* Develop in successive iterations
