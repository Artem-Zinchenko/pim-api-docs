# How to build your connector?

Now that you have a good overview of your connector data flows and Akeneo PIM data and features, you are probably wondering how to build your connector.
Here are some of our recommendations!

## A "Connection-compliant" connector

The best way to interact with Julia's PIM is to develop a "[Connection-compliant](https://help.akeneo.com/pim/serenity/articles/what-is-a-connection.html)" connector (based on our API).

## Follow the guide!

All you need to know to interact with our PIM through our API can be found in our [dedicated tutorial](https://api.akeneo.com/getting-started/connect-the-pim-4x/welcome.html).

## Step by step

**Our recommendation: always listen to your customer's needs first.**

We are aware that it is quite difficult to develop a 100% complete connector that fits all your customer's needs immediately.

Once you are comfortable with your customer's needs, our recommendation is to follow the steps we describe and to iterate in order not to miss any important feature. Building an ERP connector is a complex task that requires a dedicated focus every step of the way.  

**Our last advice: adopt an Agile approach!**

* Interview Julia and ERP team about their needs
* Set priorities with them
* Develop in successive iterations
