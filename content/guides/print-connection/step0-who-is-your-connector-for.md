# Who is your connector for?

## Personas

You will find below user archetypes we use to help you guide your decisions about product features, interactions, and even visual design of your connector. By designing for the archetype — whose goals and behavior patterns are well understood — you can satisfy the broader group of people represented by that archetype.

## Personas' needs

You will find below the main needs, associated to each user profile, in terms of process, documentation, actions related to your future print connector.

Let's already address 2 different needs:
1. The need to create a complete print catalog from PIM information.
2. The ability to create a PDF or product brochure on demand from one or more PIM products.


### Julia's needs

Julia needs an easy way to export her PIM data into your print solution (sometimes associated to Adobe InDesign / Adobe Illustrator).

After import, the PIM product information is formatted either automatically through a template or manually by the print team.

So she needs:

* An **easy to follow process** to import automatically her PIM data into the print solution.

* A **friendly Connector UI** to trigger manually the connector on demand.

* A **friendly UI** to log all automatic and manual import processes and a notification system to be alerted when something goes wrong.

### Peter and/or Filips' needs

Peter and/or Filips needs a easy way to install, configure and maintain your connector.

So they need:

* If needed, an **easy to follow download/installation process:** to retrieve and install your connector.

* A **full documentation** about **the limits of the connector** in terms of **scalability** and **performance**.

* An **easy to follow configuration process** to set up the connection between the Akeneo PIM and your print solution as well as parameters to configure the connector. It requires documentation to explain the methodology on how to configure your connector compared to your business needs.

* A **friendly import process** to perform the first import of the PIM data into your print solution. Due to the volume of data to be imported, this may require special support from your end.

* A **connector UI or a configuration file to set up the connector** (PIM connection, flexible filtering capabilities, …)

* An access to the **connector logs** to have all detailed technical information to investigate errors.

* A **documentation or a process** to know **how to customize** your connector compared to Julia's project (if needed). We know that each client project is specific and most of the time there will be a need to adapt your connector to particular contexts.
