# Introduction

The PHP client facilitates the usage of the API in your PHP projects when building extensions and/or tools for your favorite PIM.

This is the V1.0.0 of the client. If you ever find a bug, do not hesitate to directly open a Github issue on the [API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client).

::: warning
Note that this PHP client only covers the **Community Edition** features of the API. We are thinking about releasing an EE version of this client which will be able to cover also the EE features of the API such as the drafts or the published products. Stay tuned! It should arrive soon!
