# Introduction

The PHP client facilitates the usage of the API in your PHP projects when building extensions and/or tools for your favorite PIM.

Two clients exist: 
- **Community Edition** client, covering the API endpoints of the PIM Community Edition
- **Enterprise Edition** client, covering the API endpoints of both the PIM Community Edition and the PIM Enterprise Edition

If you ever find a bug, do not hesitate to directly open a Github issue on the [CE API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client) or the [EE API client repository](https://github.com/akeneo/php-api-client-ee).

If you just want to discuss about it, join the community in the [#web-api](https://akeneopim-ug.slack.com/messages/web-api/) channel in our [Slack user group community](https://akeneopim-ug.herokuapp.com/).
