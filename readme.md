# Akeneo Web API documentation
This repository holds the sources for the documentation of the web API that will be released in 1.7.

**It's work in progress.**

## Installation for dev/preview purposes

### Requirements
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is required.

### Locale installation
Once Node installed, run:

```bash
npm install

gulp serve
```

Documentation is then available on `localhost:8000`.
Files located in the content and src directories are watched for changes, so when developing you do not need to launch any other task.

## Deployment
